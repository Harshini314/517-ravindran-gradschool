# My Grad School Journey So Far

When I decided I was going to get back into grad school, the next immediate step was to look into the schools that offered masters in technical communication.


## Choosing Schools

With my academic goals in mind, I chose to apply to the following colleges:

* NC State University 
* Missouri S&T
* Arizona State University

I then did a detailed analysis and ranked these colleges as follows according to how :

1. [NC State](www.ncsu.com)
2. [ASU](https://asuonline.asu.edu)
3. [Missouri S&T](www.mst.edu)

I based my decision on the college rankings given [here][another link].
